                                We at ByteSize know the struggle that's putting some time aside on our day to cooking, especially when we all have so many other important things to do and ordering food is just one tap away.
                                Some of us may also not be good cooks or not even know how to cook at all. So to address all those issues, we cretated ByteSize, a website that helps us coders with some cooking inspiration and some step-by-step guide on delicioius and easy-to-cook meals.
                                So what are you waiting on? Let's make cooking be as easy as writing code!
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            So if you're just like us, and programming is your love language, but the kitchen not so much, then come right on 'cause we're going to show you how to give that belly the fuel that it needs.
